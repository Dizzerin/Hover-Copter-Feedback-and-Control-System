# Hover Copter Feedback and Control System
This project is a hover arm designed to hover with the arm horizontal (parallel with the ground).  The system can account for outside disturbances such as being hit downwards or upwards and will level itself again.  This project was for a Feedback and Control Systems class offered at Walla Walla University.
Note: There is room for more development on this project, however the system is currently working with feedback and will correct for disturbances as expected!
